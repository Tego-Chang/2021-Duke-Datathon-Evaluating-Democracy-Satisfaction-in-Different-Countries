# 2021-Duke-Datathon-Evaluating-Democracy-Satisfaction-in-Different-Countries

A team project collaborated with Cindy Chiu, Haoliang Jiang, and Vicki Nomwesigwa

One of the core missions of Asian Barometer Survey is to strengthen intellectual and institutional
capacity for research on democracy. This research is going to put their mission into
practice. In the dataset released, for those variables which are considered important, we found
that most of them can be considered either directly or indirectly related to reflecting the society
status of a country. Thus, we plan to make this research more lean to investigate what people think
about their government. In this study, we will use the q098, which is the democracy satisfaction
as our outcome of our model. As we tend to believe that how a government leans on democracy
can really affect its people and the entire society, we plan to conduct our research to examine the
acknowledgement.

Based on that, we have surveyed some materials for further making our topic more concrete.
The previous studies on the Asian Barometer Survey focus on one specific country, for instance,
the democratic satisfaction in China (Zhai, 2019). We decided to analyze all the countries from the
Asian Barometer Survey and provide an overview of satisfaction in different countries. Therefore,
in this research we will base on the characteristics of the people and the society to predict how
people think democracy is functioning in their country. In another word, we want to leverage the
survey data to analyze how people in different regions are satisfied with the democracy in their
country.
